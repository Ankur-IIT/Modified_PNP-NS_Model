# Modified_PNP-NS_Model
This repository implements the FEM for the Modified Poisson–Nernst–Planck/Navier-Stokes (PNP/NS) Model from the paper "Finite Element Method for the Numerical Simulation of Modified PNP/NS Model" (arXiv:2409.08746). The model is solved for parameters like temperature and bulk modulus to study system stability.
